# Getting started with emails

Thesez-Vous platform allow you to use multiple Email Service Provider and to custom every email sent by the platform.

## ESP supported

Since we use Anymail for all our sending of email you can use any ESP officially supported in 
its documentation [Anymail documentation][anymail-supported-esp]

!!! Note
    Since SendinBlue is our loved choice for internal development, it's the only one ESP fully tested 
    with the platform. However, if you have a problem with one of the other ESP supported by Anymail, feel free 
    to contact the support team to evaluate the problem and enhance the support to your favorite ESP.
