## Limitation on memberships

Retreats can be limited to specific memberships in order to force user buy membership before access specific retreat.

You can limit retreat to one or multiple memberships, or you can let it available to everyone by not selecting 
any memberships in the memberships field of the retreat.

!!! tip
    Limitation on memberships work on membership already active on the user but also on membership in his cart at 
    the moment he buy the retreat. This allow the user to buy a specific membership AND a retreat limiter to this 
    specific membership at the same time with only one financial transaction.

## Hidden retreat

Hidden retreats are retreat only available by invitation links that are not public as long as everybody share 
it properly. They are exactly as a default retreat but they are only available from the invitations link. 

To create an hidden retreat you just need to create a retreat and define it as `hidden` in its attributes

## Invitation link

Invitation link allow user to reserve the retreat from a specific link and can contain some privileges to help sales. 
They are used in multiples context as for reserve place for a subset of user or to handle hidden retreat.

When you create a retreat invitation, you will need to ask you some questions:

**What is a proper internal name to be able to differentiate each invitation link**

It's important to have a good management of the links since deadlines and money are to take in context

**How many people can reserve place from this link at maximum**

It's really important in case your retreat is an hidden retreat since it will not be available from the default 
flow of the platform. 
 
**Do you want this invitation to have reserved place in the retreat**

If you active this option it will block the invitation link number of places on the default flow, so people using 
the link are sure to have the number of place defined in the link even if people without link tried to reserve 
places before them. 

## virtual retreat

Virtual retreats are a type of retreat that allow user to access video-conference link in case they reserve a place 
to the retreat.

The link of the video-conference is visible 30 minutes before the beginning of the retreat, in order to let him some 
time of setup if necessary
