## Duration

Membership are most of the time defined to 1 year in Thesez-Vous but you're free to define a different duration to each
memberships of the platform. This allow you, for example, to create a membership of 3 month only or of 2 years.

## Limitation on academic levels

All the membership created inside the platform are available on conditions based on user's academic level. You can 
set it available to only one or multiple membership but it's also possible to set it available to everybody by adding 
no one academic level in the academic level field of the membership. 

!!! warning
    User can define his academic level during his registration but have no way to edit it after. It's a limitation 
    since some users can submit error on their profile during the registration or can have some changes in their 
    status in the future.

## Renewal of membership

There is no auto-renewal of membership in the platform but members have the right to renew their membership 30 
days before the end of their memberships.

When user renew before the end of his memberships the new membership will be the one selected of the user but the 
duration will be the duration of membership selected in addition to the time remaining of the old membership. 

!!! warning
    If user bought a membership for 10$ and renew 30 days before to a membership at 100$ he got 30 days of a 
    better membership without paying the difference. You always need to keep that in mind in case of specific usage.
